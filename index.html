            <h2>Church Redesign</h2>
            <p>Date: 12-5-23</p>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Christ The Rock is an apostolic church based in Stevens Point, WI, dedicated to serving its community. The website features a minimalist design that highlights church events and services times. The website is very straightforward, and has a simple layout, where users can find details about certain events. It also features a small calendar that highlights static events throughout the week.</p> 
            <p><strong>Current website for "Christ The Rock Apostolic Church" </strong></p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>I was tasked with redesigning a church website to address obvious usability issues, including unclear navigation, broken links, and excessive white space. As a UX/UI designer, I wanted to focus on enhancing user experience by improving navigation, fixing broken/unnecessary links, and the overall layout. By applying key usability principles I learned, I created a more user-friendly design that better supports the needs of its visitors.</p>
            
            <h3>Initial Concerns</h3>
            <p>When you're using the website, sometimes it's not clear which items you can click on because they're not properly labeled. This makes it a bit confusing for the user, and might cause them miss out on some important features. As I looked further into the app, I noticed that the links all led to the same place and the page wasn't viewable. </p>
            
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>The solutions I implemented in my design aimed to improve navigation, increase user engagement, and easily get involved within the community.</p>

            <h3>My role in the project</h3>
            <p>I was the sole designer, I was responsible for creating the wireframes, coming up with different solutions to some of the problems and collaborating with different classmates to get their feedback.</p>

            <h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
            <p>When first beginning the initial design for this project, I was unsure of where to start along with unfamiliarity with the design tool, Figma. I practiced outside of class on Figma to learn the different tools and limitations. Once I was more comfortable, I researched different church website to familiarize myself with the layouts they used and how they presented their information. I used these different design ideas to then begin my redesign for this project. </p>

            <h3>How would this affect the business?</h3>
            <p>If my design was implemented and was used in the church, it would have a very positive impact. New users would be able to access certain information such as, contact details, event locations, who the pastor is, and what services the church offers. This would, in turn, increase the user engagement and attract new members. </p>

            <h3>What i learned</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I learned and gained a variety of skills such as, project planning, how to collaborate with classmates and provide feedback, Figma Design, how to present my project to stakeholders, creating user stories, how to prioritize the user and their needs, and put myself in their shoes. </p>

            <h2>Early Designs</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the early wireframes and designs for the church websites. In this initial design phase, I combined inspiration from different websites to combine different elements and create a more user friendly layout that would make visitors feel comfortable and familiar with the site. My approach focused on making the design feel intuitive, welcoming, and easy to navigate, while also taking into consideration the different needs of the audience I want to target.

                In this phase, I included the wireframes for both the homepage and about page, each designed with collapsible navigation bars for a clean and more organized user experience. The collapsible feature makes sure that users can quickly access key sections without feeling overwhelmed by too much information all at once. Additionally, I made sure to maintain a balance between aesthetics and functionality, focusing on clear visual hierarchy, and straightforward interactions.</p>

            <p>I made several significant changes to my final prototype based on the constructive feedback I received from both my instructor and my peers. After reviewing their suggestions and comments, I then focused on refining the main elements of the prototype to enhance user experience and improve how the website would function.</p>

            <p>One of the major changes I made was improving the navigation bar,  I decided to go with a nav bar that was more popularly used and would not confuse new users.   This changed aimed to improve usability and making sure the navigation was more simplified and clearer/easier to use.</p>

            <p>Another major change I made was adjusting the home page’s content and layout to make it more engaging and better aligned with the user's needs. I felt that the current design improves visual flow and makes it more readable compared to before, this also creates a more welcoming experience for users. </p>

            <h2>PHP</h2>
            <p>Date: 5-8-25</p>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>People Helping People (PHP) is a platform designed to connect volunteers with people in need of assistance. The goal of the project was to make it easier for volunteers to find jobs and for individuals in need to find reliable help in their community.</p>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>At the time, both volunteers and people in need struggled to connect. Volunteers had difficulty finding jobs that matched their skills or schedule, while people seeking help often couldn’t find trustworthy volunteers. The website aimed to solve these issues by creating a platform where these two groups could easily meet and collaborate.</p>

            <h3>Initial Concerns</h3>
            <p>One of the initial concerns was ensuring that the website would be easy to use for individuals of all ages and technical backgrounds. Another key concern was the safety and reliability of both the volunteers and those requesting assistance. It was essential to design a site that was simple, accessible, and secure for all users.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>To address these challenges, we created a website with a clean, simple design that included tools to help match volunteers with people in need. Features like login, profile customization, job filtering and job posts were added. We also made sure that the site was accessible to people with disabilities and offered tech support for those who needed assistance.</p>

            <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
            <p>As the leader of this group project, I was responsible for guiding the overall direction of the website. I led the team in designing the prototype using my wireframes, making sure that the site was intuitive and user-friendly. I also made sure that we considered the needs of all users, especially those with disabilities.</p>

            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was designing a site that would be user-friendly for individuals with varying levels of technical knowledge. Balancing simplicity with the need for multiple features was also difficult, as we wanted to make sure the site was functional yet easy to navigate. Ensuring accessibility for all users was another challenge that required extra attention. Additionally, communication within the group was not always reliable, which caused some misalignments and slowed progress. Working on the same code also proved to be challenging, as not everyone was consistently working with the updated version of the code, leading to conflicts and confusion. We overcame these issues by improving our communication and establishing clearer version control practices. In the end, it was a valuable lesson in teamwork and collaboration.</p>

            <h3>Impact on the Business</h3>
            <p>If this website were approved by the stakeholders and fully implemented, it would improve connections between volunteers and those in need, making it easier for both groups to find what they are looking for. This would lead to higher user engagement, more trust in the platform, and continued growth and success.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>This project taught me the importance of creating a simple and accessible user experience. I learned how to balance design with functionality and ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, could easily navigate the platform. Leading this project helped me improve my design skills, including my proficiency with Figma and other design tools. I also strengthened my ability to manage and guide a team to achieve a common goal.</p>

            <p>We made a few changes to the final website after getting helpful feedback from our instructor and classmates. These suggestions helped us make the site easier to use and more effective overall. </p>
            
            <p>A big change was updating the homepage layout and content. I wanted it to feel more welcoming and easier to read. The new layout improved the visual flow and made important information stand out more. These updates made the homepage more useful and better matched the needs of our users.  </p>

            <p>We also included a login page to allow users to access their personal profiles securely. In addition, we created a job request page, where users can post help requests or respond to others, which added an important feature to support the purpose of the platform.</p>

            <p>To keep the design consistent across all pages, we created a color scheme as well as a design system for the website. The design system included guidelines for fonts, buttons, spacing, and reusable components, which helps developers by providing a clear reference to follow. This makes the development process more efficient and organized while ensuring future updates or additions stay visually consistent with the rest of the site. We wanted the colors to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for users. By using soft, inviting tones, we aimed to make the site feel more approachable and comfortable, encouraging users to spend more time exploring and engaging with the platform. The colors were chosen to evoke positive emotions and create a sense of trust, making users feel at ease as they navigate the site and participate in the community.</p>

            <h2>Zwift</h2>
            <p>Date: 10-19-23</p>
            <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Zwift is an online fitness platform that combines cycling and running, into a gaming format. The Zwift Companion app provides tools for tracking performance, connecting with others, and celebrating personal achievements.</p>
                <p><strong>Zwift App </strong></p>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <img src="images/Zwift_Companion.webp">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>The Zwift Companion app lacked a feature to visually showcase a user’s fitness journey. Users wanted an engaging and motivating way to track their progress, including milestones and personal records, in a more personalized, easy to navigate format. The existing app didn’t provide a way to view this information in an intuitive and visually appealing way.</p>

                <h3>Initial Concerns</h3>
                <p>At the start of the project, I was concerned about introducing a new feature to an existing app. The challenge was  designing something entirely fresh without disrupting the current user experience. I also had to consider multiple ways to design this feature without personally using this app, so researching in depth took some time and I had multiple questions that were thankfully answered in online forums. My classmates were also helpful when we asked questions in class and got eachothers feedback.</p>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>The solution was to design a scrolling timeline feature within the Zwift Companion app that would track the user’s fitness milestones. Each point on the timeline would represent significant achievements, from the first recorded activity to the latest personal record. This would offer users a personalized, engaging way to see their progress, motivating them to continue their fitness journey. I incorporated color indicators for milestone types, though further refinement was needed to make the colors more meaningful.</p>

                <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
                <p>I led the design of the timeline feature in the Zwift Companion app. This involved brainstorming the initial concept, creating mockups, and refining the user experience based on feedback. I worked collaboratively with classmates, incorporating user journey insights and refining the design to ensure usability. The timeline was my original idea, and I focused on making it visually engaging while maintaining functionality acrossthe mobile platform.</p>

                <h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
                <p>One challenge was choosing the best idea for the timeline. I had several options but picked the timeline because it was new and unique. Making sure the timeline worked well on a mobile interface was also tricky as my experience was limited in Figma and I had to ensure that it was compact but still was visually appealing. Another challenge was the color scheme, I used the existing colors on Zwift to make sure this feature blended in with the rest of the pages.</p>

                <h3>How Would This Affect the Business?</h3>
                <p>Once fully implemented, the timeline feature would enhance user engagement by offering an interactive and motivating way to track fitness progress. This would encourage users to spend more time in the app and connect with their fitness goals. By visualizing personal achievements, users would feel more motivated, which could drive user retention and satisfaction. Ultimately, this could lead to higher active user numbers and contribute to Zwift’s success in the competitive fitness market.</p> 

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>This project taught me how to think outside the box and create new and innovative features for an app. I learned how to design for different platforms and working independately helped me get more used to Figma and allowed me to work at my own pace which also allowed me to get familiar with doing my own research and asking questions.I also learned the importance of user feedback in making design improvements and how to approach challenges when trying something new.</p>

                <p>A significant change I made was improving the layout of the timeline. Now, when users click on a milestone in the timeline, a box pops up that displays the full details of that achievement. To ensure the user’s focus remains on the timeline, I added a greyed-out background effect when the box appears. This visual cue helps users stay concentrated on the content of the timeline, preventing distractions from other elements on the screen.</p>
