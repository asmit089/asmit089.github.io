            <h2>Church Redesign</h2>
            <p>Date: 12-5-23</p>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Christ The Rock is an apostolic church based in Stevens Point, WI, dedicated to serving its community. The website features a minimalist design that highlights church events and services times. The website is very straightforward, and has a simple layout, where users can find details about certain events. It also features a small calendar that highlights static events throughout the week</p> 
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <div class="image-placeholder">
                    <img src="./images/" alt="Image 1">
                </div>

                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>I was tasked with redesigning a church website to address obvious usability issues, including unclear navigation, broken links, and excessive white space. As a UX/UI designer, I wanted to focus on enhancing user experience by improving navigation, fixing broken/unnecessary links, and the overall layout. By applying key usability principles I learned, I created a more user-friendly design that better supports the needs of its visitors.</p>
            
            <h3>Initial Concerns</h3>
            <p>When you're using the website, sometimes it's not clear which items you can click on because they're not properly labeled. This makes it a bit confusing for the user, and might cause them miss out on some important features. As I looked further into the app, I noticed that the links all led to the same place and the page wasn't viewable </p>
            
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>The solutions I implemented in my design aimed to improve navigation, increase user engagaement, and easily get involved within the community</p>

            <h3>My role in the project</h3>
            <p>I was the sole designer, I was responsible for creating the wireframes, coming up with different solutions to some of the problems and collabartaing with different classmates to get their feedback</p>

            <h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
            <p>When first beginning the initial design for this project, I was unsure of where to start along with unfamilarity with the design tool, Figma. I practiced outside of class on Figma to learn the different tools and limitations. Once i was more confortable, I researched different church website to familiarise myself with the layouts they used and how they presented their information. I used these different design ideas to then begin my redesign for this project. </p>

            <h3>How would this affect the business?</h3>
            <p>If my design was implemented and was used in the church, it would have a very positive impact. New users would be able to access certain information such as, contact details, event locations, who the pastor is and even the many services the church has to offer. This would, in turn, increase the user engagement and attract new members </p>

            <h3>What i learned</h3>
            <p>Through this project, I learned and gaines a variety of skills such as, project planning, how to collaborate with classmates and provide feedback, Figma Design, how to present my project to stakeholders, creating user stories, how to prioritze the user and their needs, and put myself in their shoes </p>

            <h2>Early Designs</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the early wireframes and designs for the church website. In this initial design phase, I combined inspiration from different websites to combine different elements and create a more user friendly layout that would make visitors feel comfortable and familiar with the site. My approach focused on making the design felt intuitive, welcoming, and easy to navigate, while also taking into consideration the different needs of the audience I want to target.

                In these phase, I included the wireframes for both the homepage and about page, each designed with collapsible navigation bars for a clean and more organized user experience. The collapsible feature makes sure that users can quickly access key sections without feeling overwhelmed by too much information all at once. Additionally, I made sure to maintain a balance between aesthetics and functionality, focusing on clear visual hierarchy, and straightforward interactions</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I made several significant changes to my final prototype based on the constructive feedback I received from both my instructor and my peers. After reviewing their suggestions and comments, I then focused on refining the main elements of the prototype to enhance user experience and improve how the website would function</p>

            <p>One of the major changes I made was improving the navigation bar,  I decided to go with a nav bar that was more popularly used and would not confuse new users.   This changed aimed to improve usability and making sure the navigation was more simplified and clearer/easier to use</p>

            <p>Another major change I made was adjusting the home page’s content and layout to make it more engaging and better aligned with the user's needs. I felt that the current design improves visual flow and makes it more readable compared to before, this also creates a more welcoming experience for users </p>
